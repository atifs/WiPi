# WiPi
Wireless media server for raspberry pi on LAN. Allows you to stream YouTube videos and your media files on your raspberry (technically, any device connected to your TV through HDMI) and show it on your TV.

#config
1. Clone this repository on your raspberry. 
2. Open the wipi folder (cloned) on raspberry
3. Run `chmod +755 boot.sh` in terminal
4. Run `./boot.sh` in terminal
5. Wait for setup to complete.

Note: For future runs, do `python3 sock.py` from terminal (after navigating to wipi folder) instead of `./boot.sh`

Please let me know about any bugs you face. Feel free to contribute.
